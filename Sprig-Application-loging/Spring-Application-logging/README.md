# log4j Features
- It is thread-safe.

- It is optimized for speed.

- It is based on a named logger hierarchy.

- It supports multiple output appenders per logger.

- It supports internationalization.

- It is not restricted to a predefined set of facilities.

- Logging behavior can be set at runtime using a configuration file.

- It is designed to handle Java Exceptions from the start.

- It uses multiple levels, namely ALL, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL.

- The format of the log output can be easily changed by extending the Layout class.

- The target of the log output as well as the writing strategy can be altered by implementations of the Appender interface.

- It is fail-stop. However, although it certainly strives to ensure delivery, log4j does not guarantee that each log statement will be delivered to its destination.
